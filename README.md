# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game extension with Spinach

This is a simple yet fun twist of the snake game with healthy food, spinach, appearing along with the regular food whenever score becomes a multiple of ten (eg, score = 10, 20, 30, etc). The spinach appears on the screen for a limited duration of 5 seconds after which it disappears. It is true in this game world (at least), that if the snake eats the spinach, the snake shrinks in size rather than increasing. It also reduces its speed by eating spinach, which helps the user play for longer. 

This is build from the starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.
